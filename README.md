# MLXHoneycrisp

This is a backend for [Honeycrisp](https://github.com/unixpickle/honeycrisp) that uses [MLX Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift) to implement all the underlying operations. At the moment, certain APIs still fallback to the CPU, but most common ones are implemented in MLX.
